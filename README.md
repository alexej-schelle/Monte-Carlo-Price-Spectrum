# monte-carlo-price-spectrum

The routine calculates a Monte Carlo spectrum of probable prices in a game theory of trade and purchase 
of a product in a given price range [a,b] with certain price start value and attractive (static) price interaction force assuming 
Poisson event distribution. 

The Monte Carlo price spectrum with maximal price sum is conjectured to be optimal for efficient trading.
